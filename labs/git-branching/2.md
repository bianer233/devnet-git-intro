# Navigating branches

Add some text to your `first.txt` with some text from Shakespeare.

`To be or not to be, that is the question!`

Commit that change.

To switch back to the `master` branch:

```
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
```

You may also see a message that your branch is ahead of `origin/master`:

```
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 2 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
```

This happens if you haven't pushed your changes to the remote.  That's fine, don't worry about it.

Open your `first.txt`.

You'll notice that the file does not contain your quote from Shakespeare.

# Merging changes

You've tested your code in your branch, and now want to include those changes in the `master` branch.

To do that, you need to execute the `git merge <branch name>` command. From the branch you want to merge into, in this case `master`:

```
$git branch
* master
  shakespeare
```

```
$ git merge shakespeare
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
 first.txt | 2 ++
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
```

Open `first.txt`, and you'll see that your merges were successful.

You can delete your branch by doing the following:

`$ git branch -d shakespeare
Deleted branch shakespeare (was 2bfb35e).`

Branches are often used when implementing new features or hotfixes.  They can be submitted for review by team members, and then once verified, can be pulled into the main codebase.

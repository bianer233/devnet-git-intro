# Navigating Branches in Git

Add some text to your `first.txt` file with some text from Shakespeare.

`To be or not to be, that is the question!`

Save your file, commit your change, and then checkout the `master` branch.

```
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
```

Once you've done that, you need to merge the content from the `shakespeare` branch.

```
$ git merge shakespeare
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
 first.txt | 2 ++
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
```

Open `first.txt`, and you'll see that your merges were successful.

You can delete your branch by doing the following:

`$ git branch -d shakespeare
Deleted branch shakespeare (was 2bfb35e).`

Branches are often used when implementing new features or hotfixes.  They can be submitted for review by team members, and then once verified, can be pulled into the main codebase.

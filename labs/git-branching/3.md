# Dealing with Merge Conflicts

At some point, you're going to have a merge conflict.  This is where you may have made overlapping changes to a file, and git can't automatically merge the changes.

Go ahead and create a new branch, `lincoln`.

Make a change to `first.txt` by adding `ca. 1800s` to the end of the Emerson quote:

```
-Letters and Social Aims. Quotation and Originality. Ralph Waldo Emerson. ca 1800s
```

Commit your change (`git commit -a -m 'add date'`).

Now switch back to the master branch.

Make a change to the same line by adding `ca 1820-1830`.  Commit your change.

Try to merge the branches with `git merge lincoln`, and you should see a message like this:

```
$ git merge lincoln
Auto-merging first.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in first.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

If you open the `first.txt` file, you should see some new entries in your file:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
-Letters and Social Aims. Quotation and Originality. Ralph Waldo Emerson. ca 1800s!
=======
-Letters and Social Aims. Quotation and Originality. Ralph Waldo Emerson. ca 1820-1830.
>>>>>>> lincoln
```

This markup is helping you see where the `HEAD` version (aka `master` in this case) is conflicting with the `lincoln` branch version.

You have to fix this manually, generally you'd use a merge tool, but we can do this simply in the text editor.

Take out this part:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
-Letters and Social Aims. Quotation and Originality. Ralph Waldo Emerson. ca 1800s!
=======
```

Save your file, and then commit.

```
$ git commit -a -m 'manually merged from branch lincoln'
[master 69a8a00] manually merged from branch lincoln
```

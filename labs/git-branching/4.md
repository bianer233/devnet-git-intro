# Stashing changes

Though not directly related to branching, stashing your changes is a handy thing to know how to do.  

Imagine a time when you might be working on some changes in a branch, and you're not quite done, but need to make a quick easy fix to a file in the repo.  Switch to the `lincoln` branch (`git checkout lincoln`), and add the famous quote from the Gettysburg Address:

```
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
```

Save your work.  Now your manager comes over and needs you to make changes to the `first.txt` file to go out on the website.  So that you don't lose your work, you can stash your changes.

```
$ git status
On branch lincoln
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   first.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

To `stash` your work, simply execute:

```
$ git stash
Saved working directory and index state WIP on lincoln: 237b267 Make date into range
HEAD is now at 237b267 Make date into range
```

Now, check out the `master` branch.

As it turns out, that date range needed to be wider: `ca 1820-1840.`

Make the change, and commit your work.

Next, check out the `lincoln` branch, and execute `git stash pop`.  This command takes the changes you have stashed, adds them back to your file, and deletes the stash.

```
$ git stash pop
On branch lincoln
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   first.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
Dropped refs/stash@{0} (484bfc5cf0b5d43328e07c398d8a4dd4901f777b)
```

You'll see that the Lincoln quote is back.  So, you can now commit your changes.

Using what you learned earlier in this lab, try to put those changes into the master branch.

Hint: you'll want to check out the master branch and perform a merge.

# Wrap up!

Good job! You have learned some of the fundamentals of `git` branching, including:

* How to branch
* How to merge
* How to stash work in progress

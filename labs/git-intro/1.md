# Objective

This lab will provide you with the fundamentals of the distributed version control system `git`.

Completion time: 30 minutes

# Prerequisites

You need a git client on your workstation.  If you are a DevNet event - such as at CiscoLive! - the workstations are pre-installed with `git`, and you must open the git shell.  Find the icon on the taskbar that looks like:

For Windows users there are two ways to interact with git on the command prompt:

* `git bash` is a UNIX-style command prompt allowing you to interact with the Windows file system.

* `git cmd` is a Windows-style command prompt allowing you to interact with the Windows files system.

Throughout the tutorial we assume that you're either working on a UNIX system or using `git bash` on Windows.

# What is version control vs. distributed version control?

Unlike version control systems like `subversion`, `git` is a **distributed** version control system.  What this means is that `git` is really great for sharing code with many individuals, and still being able to keep your changes in-sync, properly versioned, with a complete replica of the commits and repo content.  

**Note:** GitHub is not the same as `git`.  GitHub is a company and a service that has popularized the `git` protocol, and provides a centralized community for discovering code.  As a small bit of trivia, `git` was largely created by Linus Torvalds -- the founder of the Linux kernel.

# Getting started with `git config`

So that you can get credit (or blame) for the work that you've contributed, you need to associate your name and email address with your work.  To do that in `git`, you use the `git config` command.

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name Comes Here"git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com
```

Now you're all set to start contributing your code!

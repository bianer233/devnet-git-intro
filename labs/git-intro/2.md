# Initialize your repository

On your workstation, make a directory in `~/src` (or if on Windows `C:\src`) called `git-intro`.  You should now have a directory structure that looks like `~/src/git-intro` or `C:\src\git-intro`.  

Change directory into `git-intro`.  

Next, you will initialize your repository (used interchangeably with "repo") with the command `git init`.

You should see a message that resembles:

`Initialized empty Git repository in <working directory>/.git/`

You now have created a local repo within your project contained in the hidden directory `.git`.  This is where all of your change history is located on your local workstation.  

# Checking status of a repo

As you work on your project, you will want to check which files have changed.  This is helpful when you are committing files to the repo, and you may only want to commit a few of them.

Still in the `git-intro` directory, type the command `git status`.

You should see the following message:

```
On branch master

Initial commit

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

This message tells you a few things:

1) that you are on branch master (we'll discuss branches later)
1) the last commit message `Initial commit`
1) that there is nothing changed to commit

You will see that the status of your repo will change once we add files and start making changes.

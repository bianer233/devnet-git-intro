# Looking at your commit history

In some cases, you may want to review the commit history for a repo.  To view the most recent commits, you use the command `git log`.  Try that now.

You should see something like:

```
commit 7be53cc330db1207c9b26fe560704f90405742fd
Author: Ashley Roach <myemail@email.com>
Date:   Sun Dec 20 07:48:29 2015 -0700

    Add inspirational quote
```

## Sidebar: Short hash vs. full hash

In our previous step, we looked at the commit has that git presented to us: `7be53cc`.  You should notice that `7be53cc` is the first 7 characters of the full commit hash above: `7be53cc330db1207c9b26fe560704f90405742fd`.

# Making changes

That may seem like a lot of work just to make a commit, but in time it will become routine for you.  Additionally, there are many `git` GUI clients out there that can automate many of these steps.

Moving forward, let's make a change to `first.txt`.  

Back in your text editor, add a new line to your file and save the file.  Add the text: `-Letters and Social Aims. Quotation and Originality. Ralph Waldo Emreson`.

```
The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today.
-Letters and Social Aims. Quotation and Originality. Ralph Waldo Emreson
```

Now when you perform `git status` you will see that there are changes in your file.

```
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   first.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

You need to stage your file again, by executing `git add`, followed by another `git commit`:

```
$ git add first.txt
$ git commit -m "Add quote attribution"
$ git log
```

Your `git log` should resemble:

```
